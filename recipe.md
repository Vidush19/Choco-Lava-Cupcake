1) Mix the dry ingredients & seive them. Melt the Chocolate & butter in the microwave or on a double boiler.

2) Brush the Ramekin with Butter & Dust with Cocoa powder.

3) Mix the Hot water, dry ingredients & chocolate butter mix to make a smooth batter. The batter should be dropping consistency and not very liquid. Slightly thicker than the Idli batter. Pour a little above 1/2 of the height of the ramekin.

4) Bake in a preheated oven in the middle rack with top & bottom heating on @ 220 degrees C for about 10 to 12 mins. It should be jiggly in the centre but dry on top.

5) Cool for about 5 minutes and then un mould on a plate. Be patient otherwise you’ll wnd up bursting it.

6) Be very attentive, if you over bake it, you won’t have the lava oozing.

The science behind this cake is that the edges become cakey but the centre is still fluid so precision is the key.
Start preheating the oven, the moment you start prepping so the oven is hot enough the moment you put the cake in.
